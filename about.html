                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>I bought the domain name “madepossiblebyfertilizer.org” in November of 2024, right after I saw the NFL contest was running again in 2024-25. This was after I took a web design class where I learned skills to build, maintain, and update websites and domains.</p><hr>
                    <p>After this, I decided to put up a “one-pager,” which is a one page website with some info on it, just to have something on the website while I work on the main site. This included a little description, a contact link, and my game/submission from last year embedded directly into the site.</p><hr>
                    <p>Next, I crafted research by taking the contest prompts, turning them into bullet points/sub points, and then researching each bullet point.</p><hr>
                    <p>Then, I have been putting this research into use, by updating the “learn” and "examples" sections of the website.</p><hr>
                    <p>Lastly, I made the video for the contest! Watch it here.</p>
